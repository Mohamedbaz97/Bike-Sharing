# Bike-Sharing
Data Analysis Project in Python using Bike Sharing dataset

In this project, we will be analyzing a dataset containing information about "Bike Sharing programs" in various cities.
Our goal is to analyze this data to gain insights into bike usage patterns and make recommendations for improving bike-sharing programs.

Based on our analysis and model, we can make the following recommendations for improving bike-sharing programs:

1- Increase bike availability during the summer months, when demand is highest.
2- Offer discounts or promotions during the weekdays, when demand is lower.
